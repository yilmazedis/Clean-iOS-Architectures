## MVP vs MVVM
As you can see, the MVVM implementation is a bit more concise 
and it's easy to see that the ViewModel is decoupled from the View, which makes it more testable.
Note: the above codes are just an example, 
it may not run as is because it's missing some part of the code such as imports and dependencies, 
also you may need to adjust the example to fit your use case.
